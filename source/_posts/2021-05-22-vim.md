How to learn Vim

- [5个免费的资源](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/28605653)
- [openVim](https://www.openvim.com/tutorial.html)

Because I want to begin my [Competitive Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueNT-w7Oluw) Life, so c++ & vim must learn!  
This is a blog about how I learn the vim.  

> It's so important that I write it before the article.

`2d3w` it's a vim instruction in Normal Mode, it can instance of a kind of vim instruction.

- First `2` is number of which u want to repeat `instruction`
- Second `d` is the kind of instruction
- Third `3`is number of which u want to repeat `action`, it'll multiply first number so it'll `dw` 6 times
- Third `w` is the kind of action

So, a whole vim instruction include `number`, `instruction`, `action`

### Instructions

#### Move

- `hjkl` is used in vim to move cursor in `Normal` Mode
- `w` can move to the beginning of next word
- `b` can move to the beginning of previous word, `B` is similar with `b`, but it can jump the punctuations
- `e` can move to the ending of next word
- `0` can move to the head of line

#### Insert

- `i` can change to `Insert` Mode, don't change cursor position
- `a` can also change to Insert Mode , but it'll let cursor position add one

#### Delete

- `x` can delete the letter, and u can use `3x` to delete 3 letters
- `dw` can delete the whole word which cursor is in
- `d$` delete util end of line
- `dd` delete the whole of line

#### Undo & Redo

- `u` can undo, `U` can undo the whole line
- `ctrl + R` can redo

#### paste & replace

- `p` can paste content in vim register(寄存器), dd, dw can set delete content into vim register
- `r` can replace the letter in word
